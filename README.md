# Image Steganography
 Application that allows to encode or decode a secret text message into a photo. Image steganography is a technique of hiding secret data within an image in such a way that the existence of the data is concealed. Unlike cryptography, which focuses on making the content of a message unreadable to unauthorized users, steganography aims to hide the fact that a message exists at all. In the context of images, this means embedding secret information into the image in a manner that is imperceptible or minimally perceptible to human observers.
